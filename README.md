# FieldVerify AI Toolkit

An open-source AI-powered solution for improving field verification quality and automating invoice validation in the address verification industry.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The address verification industry, particularly in emerging markets like Nigeria, faces two critical challenges:

**Field Verification Errors**: Field agents frequently verify incorrect addresses due to unclear instructions, GPS manipulation, or human oversight, resulting in quality control issues and client disputes.

**Invoice Validation Bottlenecks**: Operations teams spend countless hours manually reviewing job reports to identify duplicates, GPS inconsistencies, and timestamp anomalies. This manual process is error-prone and creates significant processing delays.

## 🚀 Solution Overview

FieldVerify AI Toolkit addresses these challenges through two integrated AI-powered components that enhance verification accuracy and automate quality control processes.

## ✨ Features

### 1. AVA – AI Verification Assistant
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Conversational AI assistant that guides field agents through the verification process
- **GPS-Based Address Confirmation**: Validates location coordinates against target addresses with built-in spoof detection
- **Intelligent Image Analysis**: Uses computer vision models (CLIP/YOLO) to automatically flag invalid photos including:
  - Blurred or low-quality images
  - Mismatched building structures
  - Irrelevant or duplicate photos
- **Real-time Quality Control**: Provides instant feedback to agents before job submission

### 2. Smart Invoice Verifier
- **Automated Report Processing**: Upload agent reports in CSV or Excel format for instant analysis
- **Intelligent Anomaly Detection**:
  - Duplicate job entries identification
  - GPS coordinate validation and mismatch detection
  - Timestamp inconsistency analysis
  - Pattern recognition for suspicious activities
- **Clean Report Generation**: Produces downloadable reports with highlighted issues and recommendations

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### AI & Machine Learning
- **Large Language Models**: Open-source models via Hugging Face Transformers for conversational AI
- **Computer Vision**: CLIP for image-text matching and YOLOv8 for object detection
- **Data Processing**: Advanced Python libraries for intelligent data validation

### Development Framework
- **Frontend**: Streamlit for intuitive web interface
- **Backend**: Python with Pandas for robust data manipulation
- **Model Integration**: Hugging Face Transformers ecosystem
- **Computer Vision**: Ultralytics YOLOv8 and OpenCLIP
- **Deployment**: Streamlit Cloud for free, scalable hosting
- **Version Control**: GitHub for open-source collaboration
